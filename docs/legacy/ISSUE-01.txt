### Implementation Notes

**Required Sections:**
1. **Format Reference** - One-line format with explanation
2. **Top Categories Table** - Quick reference table with category, symbol, and use case
3. **Status Lifecycle** - Visual flow of status transitions
4. **Common Patterns** - 3-5 most common tag patterns Pierre will use
5. **Search Cheatsheet** - Quick search command templates
