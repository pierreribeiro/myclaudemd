TITLE:
[Task 2] Backup claude.md v1.6.0 Before Integration

LABELS:
haiku-4.5, priority:high, phase-2-integration, operational

DESCRIPTION:
## Task: Backup claude.md v1.6.0

**Priority:** High (Safety Critical)
**Assigned Model:** Haiku 4.5
**Estimated Time:** 2 minutes
**Dependencies:** None

### Objective

Create a byte-identical backup of claude.md v1.6.0 before any integration work begins. This is a safety measure to enable easy rollback if needed.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Backup file created at `claude.md.v1.6.0.backup`
- [ ] File is byte-identical to original `claude.md`
- [ ] File size matches original (32,651 bytes)
- [ ] Backup verified (checksum or diff comparison)
- [ ] Git committed separately for safety

### Implementation Notes

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create backup
cp claude.md claude.md.v1.6.0.backup

# Verify byte-identical
diff claude.md claude.md.v1.6.0.backup
# (Should produce no output)

# Check size
ls -lh claude.md*
```

**Safety:**
- This backup is critical - do not skip verification
- Commit backup to git separately before proceeding with Task 4

### Deliverable

- File: `claude.md.v1.6.0.backup` (32,651 bytes, identical to original)

### Handover Template

```markdown
## Task #2 Handover - Backup claude.md v1.6.0

### ✅ Completed
- [X] Backup created: claude.md.v1.6.0.backup
- [X] Byte-identical verification: PASS
- [X] File size verification: PASS

### 📊 Status
**Files Created:**
- `claude.md.v1.6.0.backup` (32,651 bytes)

**Verification Results:**
```
diff claude.md claude.md.v1.6.0.backup
[output - should be empty]

ls -lh claude.md*
[output showing both files with identical sizes]
```

### 📝 Technical Notes
Backup created successfully. Original claude.md v1.6.0 is safe and can be restored at any time.
