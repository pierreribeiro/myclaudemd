TITLE:
[Task 7] Backward Compatibility Testing for claude.md v1.7.0 [CRITICAL]

LABELS:
sonnet-4.5, priority:critical, phase-2-integration, testing

DESCRIPTION:
## Task: Backward Compatibility Testing

**Priority:** CRITICAL (Validates no regressions)
**Assigned Model:** Sonnet 4.5 REQUIRED (semantic understanding needed)
**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Dependencies:** Task #4 (Integration)

### Objective

Verify that claude.md v1.7.0 maintains 100% backward compatibility with v1.6.0. All existing features, personas, guardrails, and behaviors must work identically.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 10 personas still defined and functional
- [ ] All TAG Activation Commands (v1.2) still present
- [ ] All guardrails (P0-P3) still defined
- [ ] All operational modes still defined
- [ ] All output formats still defined
- [ ] No sections accidentally modified
- [ ] No sections accidentally deleted
- [ ] TAG System section doesn't interfere with existing features
- [ ] Comprehensive test report generated
- [ ] Zero regressions detected

### Implementation Notes

**Testing Approach:**

1. **Structural Comparison**
   ```bash
   # Extract section headers from v1.6.0
   grep "^##" claude.md.v1.6.0.backup > v1.6.0-sections.txt

   # Extract section headers from v1.7.0
   grep "^##" claude.md > v1.7.0-sections.txt

   # Compare (should only show TAG System as new)
   diff v1.6.0-sections.txt v1.7.0-sections.txt
   ```

2. **Persona Verification**
   - Verify all 10 personas listed in v1.6.0 are present in v1.7.0
   - Check persona definitions are unchanged

3. **TAG Activation Commands Verification**
   - Verify TAG Activation Commands (v1.2) section exists
   - Check all persona activation patterns (`@persona@`) still present
   - Confirm no conflict with new search tags

4. **Guardrails Verification**
   - Verify all guardrails (P0, P1, P2, P3) still present
   - Check definitions unchanged

5. **Operational Modes Verification**
   - Verify all modes still defined
   - Check descriptions unchanged

6. **Content Diff Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Detailed diff to verify only additions
   diff -u claude.md.v1.6.0.backup claude.md > integration.diff

   # Analyze diff:
   # - Should show TAG System section as additions (+)
   # - Should show minimal metadata changes
   # - Should show NO deletions or modifications to existing content
   ```

7. **Integration Test**
   - Verify TAG System section doesn't conflict with surrounding sections
   - Check that search tags (`#CATEGORY`) and persona tags (`@persona@`) are clearly distinct
   - Verify examples in TAG System are appropriate
