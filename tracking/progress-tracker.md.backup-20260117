## 📋 PRE-FLIGHT WORKFLOW (CRITICAL)

### Before Executing ANY Task:

```
STEP 0: DETAIL SPRINT ISSUES (IF NEEDED)
├─ Check if current sprint's GitHub issues are fully detailed
├─ If issues #X-Y have only basic template → Detail them FIRST
└─ Update each issue with: Objectives, Actions, Deliverables, Acceptance Criteria

STEP 1: CHECK FLIGHT PLAN
├─ Locate task in this document
├─ Read objectives and acceptance criteria
└─ Verify dependencies are satisfied

STEP 2: UPDATE STATUS → ONGOING
├─ Change task status from ⏸️ to 🔄
├─ Add start date
└─ Commit change to Git

STEP 3: READ GITHUB ISSUE
├─ Navigate to issue number in GitHub
├─ Review full description and requirements
├─ Check comments for additional context
└─ Verify assignee (Haiku vs Sonnet)

STEP 4: EXECUTE WORK
├─ Follow issue instructions
├─ Create deliverables as specified
├─ Test according to acceptance criteria
└─ Document any deviations

STEP 5: CLOSE ISSUE
├─ Update issue with completion notes
├─ Link to deliverables/artifacts
├─ Close issue in GitHub
└─ Reference in PR if applicable

STEP 6: UPDATE FLIGHT PLAN
├─ Change status from 🔄 to ✅
├─ Update completion percentage
├─ Log actual vs estimated effort
└─ Commit final status to Git
```

**CRITICAL**: Never skip steps. STEP 0 added - detail sprint issues before execution.
